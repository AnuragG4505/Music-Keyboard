# Music-Keyboard
In this project, you would find four sounds which play when you type a specific key in your keyboard.
It is just a MViT (Minimum Viable iDEA Test) as a hobby.

Here is how I got an idea to build it:
One day, while listening to music I had an idea what if I can make a keyboard which can make music.
Initially, I thought that while I would be coding, the keyboard would paly a music seeing my typing speed and mouse movements. 
So, to test it's working potential I build this dummy project.

Working:
It uses the pygames and keyboard libraries present in Python.
If you press the key A : It will make a Cow Mooing sound
If you press the key N : It will make a Dog Woofing sound
If you press the key U : It will make a Goofy Car Horn sound
If you press the key R : It will make a Horse sound sound

Enjoy playing around with it.
